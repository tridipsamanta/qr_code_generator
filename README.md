## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1️⃣ QR Generation
- User selects a **QR type**
- Relevant input fields appear dynamically
- QR updates automatically on input change

### 2️⃣ Theme System
- Each theme defines:
  - Background
  - Accent color
  - Default QR color
  - Light / dark mode flag
- Active theme is stored in `localStorage`

### 3️⃣ QR Color Logic
- QR background is always **white** for scan reliability
- Dark themes enforce **high-contrast QR colors**
- User-selected colors override theme defaults safely

### 4️⃣ History Storage
Each generated QR is saved with:
```json
{
  "type": "url",
  "data": "https://example.com",
  "color": "#00d9ff",
  "theme": "midnight-black",
  "timestamp": 1700000000000
}
